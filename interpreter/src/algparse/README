This module is concerned with parsing Tarski Formulas.
It provides:

  - class LexContext: which allows you to define the lexical
    context for parsing.  Currently, any istream can be used
    as the basis for the lexical context.

  - classes TarskiObj/TarskiRef and their derived classes, which
    provide the data structure for the parsed formula.

  - function algparse(LCp,T), which parses from the lexical context
    pointed to by LCp and stores the result in TarskiRef T.

  - class TarskiApply, which allows the definition of function
    objects that are polymorphic on their first argument.  This
    provides a mechanism for traversing the parse tree.

  - function objects GetVars and PrettyPrint, which perform two
    usefull operations on Tarski formulas.

  - main.cpp, which defines a small driver program that simply 
    reads a formula or algebraic expression (wrapped in [ ]'s)
    and pretty prints it and then prints it in another sort
    of form.

01/11/2007 - now has the -r option for printing in Redlog format
