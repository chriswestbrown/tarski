This code serves two purposes:

1. general-purpose parse SMT (at least first-order theory of the reals inputs).

2. add a function to Tarski

   (load-smtlib <filename>)

   ... that reads the named file up to the first (check-sat) building a 
   formula (conjunction of each of the assert's) and returns the formula.
   
   The big question is what to do with division by non-constants.  There
   are several options:
   a. disallow it
   b. clear denominators under the assumption that the author of the formula
      has "guarded" each use of division to ensure that the vanishing of the
      denominator can be ignored for that atom.
   c. clear denominators with the symantic understanding that x/y ro 0
      means y /= 0 /\ x*y ro 0
   d. treat division by zero as an uninterpreted function


   b /= 0 ==> [a/b ro 0 <==> a b ro 0]
