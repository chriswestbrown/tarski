ITEMS TO ADDRESS (In no order)

* Rational expressions - i.e. non-constant denominators
  Do I allow?

* Add <== and <==> ?

* Tarski should allow boolean variables as well as
  algebraic variables

* Tarski should have a substution operator, e.g.
  F:x=[3+y]

* Tarski should have a "current context" and the
  ability to define contexts and declare facts in
  contexts maybe?  e.g.
  C = newContext()
  assert(C,[x > 0 /\ x^2 + y > 3 ])
  switchContext(C)
  F = [ex a, b[ x a - 2 b y = 0 /\ a^2 + b^2 = 1]]
  
* Tarski needs commands to normalize in different
  contexts.

IDEAS: 12/02/2008
My whiteboard has lots of plans for things to look into.  However, what about
starting to work towards a system for solving non-trivial QE problems in a
flexible way?  Then I'd have something perhaps to release?

- Input: I should allow arbitrary formulas.
- Solutions should come with an explanation of how they were arrived at.
- a) normalize -> factor apart on all variables -> treat factors separately
  b) within each factor of the above we have something that doesn't
     factor, ???
