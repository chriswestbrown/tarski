This is working towards an API that will work for my capstone group.


register( string s, int sigma)
Input: s is a string in SMTLIB representing a polynomial.
       let's are not allowed, but division is ... though be
       warned that I will clear denominators!  It's incumbent
       on whomever provides the formula to ensure that any
       denominators are appropriately guarded from being zero.

       sigma is a relop according to the usual scheme.


Here is sample input for ./atest
r < (* (* x x) (- y 1))
s 1 1
s 2 5
t 1 1 2 5
