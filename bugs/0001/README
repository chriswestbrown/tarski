SUMMARY
On sin problem, get different results based on whether or not 'clear
option is used.

On tmp problem, w/o clear the input won't be read.  There's a div with
constant denom, which the w/o-clear seems to accept on the sin problem,
so there's some kind of mismatch there.

The file tmp.smt2 shows a small version of what's causing the problem.

ACTION
In prettyprint.cpp, I had to wrap an extra ()'s around unary minus.
Fixed in rev149.
