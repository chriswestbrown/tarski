STATUS: CLOSED

SUMMARY
I get a segfault from:

(wbsat [ x = 0 /\ y = 0 /\ x y >= 0 ])

... ugh!

ACTION
In solver-manager.cpp

std::vector<size_t> SolverManager::proxy_sorted_indices(std::vector<Deduction> &deds)

... there was a hack in which the "substituter" is assumed to
exist at solvers[2].  When wbsat is called, there is no
"substituter", so we got the segfault.  This was fixed by
having each solver checked to see if it's a substituter.  If
one exists, then the substitution level is factored into the
sorting.  Otherwise, all substitution levels are set to 0.
