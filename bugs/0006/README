STATUS: CLOSED

SUMMARY

(bbwb [ x >= 0 /\ x y <= 0 /\ y <= 0 ]) produces a "simplified"
formula that's exactly the input. Why isn't it seeing that
x y <= 0 is implied by the other two?  Note: normalize works here!

ACTION
The error was in blackbox-solve / minWtMain(...).  "Step 15" was
essentially being ignored.  I added the code that explicitly
checked for it and added the deduction it required.
