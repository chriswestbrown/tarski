SUMMARY
There is a bug in sol G that causes a crash

* in2 is the simplest example input I have for this bug

It looks like sfcons/GEOTEST is where the problem stems
from.  In Step 2 we are supposed to partition this set of
cells so that (I believe) there is a single formula that
separates the true from false cells in the stacks above
cells.  That seems not to be working right so that when
I go to construct the formula (call to NAIVESF in Step 3)
I get a segfault.
