SUMMARY
The following input hangs ...

(qepcad-qe [ all x [ [ x < 0 \/ x = 0 ] ==> x <= 0 ] ])

ACTION
In qepcad-session.h, I added a case for when calling d-witness
returns "Command only valid for SAT problems!".  This is a little
bit klugey, since I really should be checking before I call the
d-witness command!
