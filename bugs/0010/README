SUMMARY
The following command 
(suggest-qepcad [all p,t,q[ 0 /= 0 /\ t < 0 /\ 0 /= 0 ==> 0 /= 0 ]])
gives a qepcad suggestion with a negative number for "number of free
variables".  Obviously, this is not good!  In particular, this causes
an error in qepcad-qe.

Another somewhat related bug ... the following input actually causes
Tarski to hang!

(def F [ex x [all y [ ex z [ x - z^2 > 0 ] ] ] ])
F

Figured it out!  the print functionality hangs if a quantifier block
has no variables.  I actually fixed the constructors so that if you
add a quantifier block with VarSet S, it only actually adds the elements
of S that appear in the formula part of the quantifier block.
HOWEVER ... if that means that there are no quantified variables at
all in any block, there are still problems.  Have to consider how I want
to deal with that, since the point is that we don't actually want a
TQBObj in that case!
