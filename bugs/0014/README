SUMMARY
(plot2d [ (3 x-2) y + x = 0 ] "200 200 -2 2 -6 6 -" '(ord (x y)))
Produces plot with extraneous line on asymptote that looks like it's part of the curve.  This problem is really a qepcad problem

ACTION
To get to this bug I had to set the way-back machine to the 1990s.  In my oldadj/ACMADJ2D.c code, which implements Arnon-Collins-McCallum adjacency, there was a bug.  Essentially I had an interval and checked that some poly p has no sign variations in the interval ... turns out I needed to ensure the p is non-vanishing at the interval endpoints too.  Ugh, not fun to find!
