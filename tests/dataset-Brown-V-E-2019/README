Data Sets from "From Simplification to a Partial Theory 
Solver for Non-Linear Real Polynomial Constraints", C. Brown
and F. Vale-Enriquez. 

A. Round 1
   - As described in the paper, these formulas are all
     conjunctions that were produced by expanding SMTLIB
     QF_NRA inputs into DNF and collecting the disjuncts.
     
   - The file round1inputs has the problems, one per line, in
     the format: 

     <name> : <formula>

     Names are of the form <smtlibname>-<disjunctnumber>, e.g.
     atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0198.smt2-4, which means the
     formula is the 5th disjunct in the DNF expansion of the
     SMTLIB formula atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0198.smt2-4.

   - The directory smtlib-r1 contains each of the formulas
     from round1inputs in smtlib format, with file name
     <name>.smt2.  So atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0198.smt2-4
     is named atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0198.smt2-4.smt2.

B. Round 2
   - As described in the paper, these inputs are conjunctions
     that were produced from the simplified equivalents of
     formulas that were not determined to be UNSAT by the
     partial solver in the Round 1 experiments.  They were
     produced by breaking <= and >= into cases "< or =" and
     "> or =" and expanding to DNF.
   
   - The file round2inputs has the problems, one per line, in
     the format: 

     <name> : <formula>

     Names are of the form <round1name>-<disjunctnumber>, e.g.
     atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0190.smt2-1-3, which means the
     4th disjunct in the expansion of round1 input problem
     atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0190.smt2-1.

   - The directory smtlib-r1 contains each of the formulas
     from round2inputs in smtlib format, with file name
     <name>.smt2.  So atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0190.smt2-1-3
     is in file atan-problem-2-weak-chunk-0190.smt2-1-3.smt2.
