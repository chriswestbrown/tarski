### SIMPLE EXAMPLE - now seems to work!

[ Here's how we would do this with regular CAD :
  NOTE: This ran out of memory after 25min computation with
        200 million cells of garbage collected space.
  NOTE2: after 115sec of cputime and 400 million cells, the Open
        CAD of 2-space was constructed with 659718 full dimensional
        cells.  After more than 4985sec (83min) of cpu time a CAD
        representing the answer was produced ... the first step of
        solution formula construction crashed due to lack of memory.
