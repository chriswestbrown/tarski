The in.a.b.c files are the non-linear test files from the ISSAC 2015
paper "Open Non-uniform Cylindrical Algebraic Decompositions."

Additionally, there are scripts that use these inputs to test the
make-NuCADConjunction command by running it, producing a defining
formula, then running qepcad to test whether the resulting formula
is "generically equivalent" to the input formula - which means that
space can be weakly decomposed into a finite number of open cells
in which the formulas are equivalent.

1. To Test all the 2-level (i.e. 2-variable)  
./runTestsLevel.2

2. To Test all the 3-level (i.e. 3-variable)  
./runTestsLevel.3

A test is a file in.a.b.c and an input formula name Fxx.  If the
result for that test is "TRUE" the test is passed.
