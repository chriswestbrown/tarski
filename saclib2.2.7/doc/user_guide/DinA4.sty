% HEIGHT
%
% Adjusting \textheight will adjust position of the bottom of the page.
% Must preserve "(\textheight - \topskip) divides \baselineskip".
% \topskip always appears to be 10pt.
% So only add/subtract multiples of \baselineskip if you want shorter pages.

\ifcase \@ptsize
    % mods for 10 pt (\baselineskip=12pt)
