1)  Need to use assembly GC routines to dump register windows.
    flush and get_pointers
2)  Modified mkmake so that *.s files are properly assembled.
    Need to make sure cpp is run so that include files are included.
3)  use varargs
4)  set CC=cc  (note this is K&R C and does not have parameter types).
    this should be set in install (want to be able to use gcc)
    In this case need to define __STDC__ in sacsys.h
5)  changed the environment variable "system" to SPARC in install
