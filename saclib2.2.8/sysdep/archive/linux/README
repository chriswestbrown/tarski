Saclib2.1 for PC's runninx linux
--------------------------------

1. The src contains the system dependent source files you'll need.

2. The includes directory contains the hfloats.h appropriate to linux
   on PC's.

3. Comment out the "#define BIG_ENDIAN" in sacsys.h.  This environment
   variable already exists in the linux C files.

4. You might want to make sure that bin/mklib doesn't contain any
   compiler flags that won't make sense on your system.  Also, be
   sure to set the environment variable CC = gcc, or else change 
   bin/mklib so that gcc (rather than cc) is the default value for 
   CC.

Note: Debian linux seems not to have the ucontext.h file required by 
FPHAND.  I don't know if this is a version problem or what, but other
linux's seem okay with it.  Try using src/FPHAND.c.debian instead of
src/FPHAND.c.

LOG:

06/18/2002 - Changed FPCATCH line 27 from

     p->sa_handler = FPHAND;     to      p->sa_sigaction = FPHAND;

     The reason for this is that sa_handler only takes an int as an
     arguments, whereas sa_sigaction takes the three parameters
     specified by FPHAND.  This doesn't affect anything in reality
     other than the type checking, since the OS doesn't really
     distinguish!
