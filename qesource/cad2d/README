CAD2D - A program for constructing CADs of 2-dimensional space.

0)  YOU MUST USE gmake TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM!

1)  This program is really just a modification of QEPCAD.  The
    few files in the src directory are all that have been
    changed.  The big difference is that the lifting is done,
    when possible, with some floating-point routines in
    extensions/lift2D.  This can save some serious time!

2)  This is still very much a work in progress.  Right now
    some very common (and in a sense generic) situations are
    still handled exactly.  I'll try to improve this soon.

3)  The plotting program may crap out when called, because
    it can't really refine sample-point coordinates when
    they haven't been computed via exact methods.  I haven't
    taught the plotting routines to work in floating-point
    yet!
