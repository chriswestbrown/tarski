summary: A system for computing with Tarski formulas and semi-algebraic sets
description: |
  Tarski is a system that provides a command-line interface to a number of
  functions for computing with Tarski formulas and semi-algebraic sets.
  It includes fast simplification and UNSAT cores for Tarski formulas,
  problem formulation for QEPCAD B, Open NuCAD construction and projection,
  read and write in smtlib syntax. The QEPCAD B system is also included.
